What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git init causes a repository to be initialized. You create .git in the folder and this lets you track changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area allows you to make changes that will be committed to the working directory from the repository. This is good because you are not changing things in either directory.
