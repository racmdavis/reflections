When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are collaborating with someone or working on multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You can choose when to pull changes which saves unecessary files being copied, which could be a problem when you don't want a certain version to be pulled.
