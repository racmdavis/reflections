When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are collaborating with someone or working on multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You can choose when to pull changes which saves unecessary files being copied, which could be a problem when you don't want a certain version to be pulled.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks involve making a copy in github. Clones involve making a copy from github to your local computer. Making a branch involves taking a file and making multiple pathways for it to follow that are individually edited and committed.
